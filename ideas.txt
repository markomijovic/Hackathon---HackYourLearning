Goals:
    - predict the time (efficiently) it would take to mine _x_ amount of BTC
    - efficiently: means minimize time and cost not just time

To Dos:
    - Coindesk btc price api
    - Coindesk usd->cad api
    - Read miner csv
    - Read wattage csv
    - Algo to determine best way to meet goals

Implemenation:
    - API (just get request), Interface called IParse ( implements parse())
        - 2 childer classes, BTCPrice, Conversion extend API implement IParse

    - CSV
        - 2 children class -> read data into a 2d array or hashmap (1 class for MinerCSV 1 for WattageCSV)
        - hashmap is like in python dict = {"columnname" = [1,2,3,4]}
    - Miner
        - takes user input for btc amount
        - 1 function that just outputs how long it would take irrelevent of everything else (still outputs profit)
        - initalizes the MinerCSV and reads data
        - method to calcualte the most efficent (profit) way using wattage and miner csv to producte the btc amount
